# GRV Financing Calculator

This is a simple web-based calculator that helps compute the full down payment, loan amount, and monthly payment for financing a vacation club membership. The calculations are based on user inputs and a fixed interest rate and loan term.

## Features
- **Inputs**:
  - Sales Price: The total cost of the vacation club membership.
  - Down Payment Percentage: The percentage of the net sales price used for the down payment.
- **Outputs**:
  - Full Down Payment (Rounded to the nearest $100).
  - Loan Amount after subtracting the down payment.
  - Monthly Payment calculated with a fixed APR of 17.9% and a 48-month term.

## Formula Details
1. **Net Sales Price** = `Sales Price - $355 (Fee)`
2. **Net Down Payment** = `Net Sales Price Ã— Down Payment Percentage`
3. **Full Down Payment (Rounded)** = `Net Down Payment + $355, rounded up to the nearest $100`
4. **Loan Amount** = `Sales Price - Full Down Payment`
5. **Monthly Payment** is calculated using the loan amortization formula:

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Enter the **Sales Price** and **Down Payment Percentage** in the input fields.
3. Click the **Calculate** button.
4. The results will display:
